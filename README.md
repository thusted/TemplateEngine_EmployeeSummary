## Description
This is a command-line application that generates an HTML file that displays information on an engineeering team based on user input. This application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user to fill out information regarding their engineering team. It will first prompt the user to enter information regarding the team's manager (the user) and then will give the user the opportunity to add engineers and interns to the team.

## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```
